Our special is a shot of five torpedos simutatly. if an asteroid is hit it 
is destroyed without creating smallest asteroids.    
        
  
FIRST CHOICE :
We chose to create 2 different lists : one
for the normal torpedos and an another one for the specials
torpedos. Why we didn't choose the same list ?
Because when we wanted to update the counter we had to know wich one modify:
the normal or the special.

SECOND CHOICE :
We chose to put the 3 lives into a list.
Why we didn't choose to use a counter for finish the game ?
We already used 2 counters and it's easier to check one 
condition if ( with the len() ) instead of use a while.

THIRD CHOICE :
We chose to determine the speeds of the torpedos in the main
class : asteroids_main. Why we didn't determine them in the
torpedo class ( in the file torpedo.py ) ?
Because it helps to make less mistake often made during class
calls in other classes. Furthermore, we create the torpedo just
after. So it's easy to define the speeds into variables that 
we will use right after in the parameters. In the fact, we 
began with the option 2 and we took a lot of time to adjust
the program that didn't run good.
